“I think there's a lot to take away from this experience from a social aspect, but this is not a normal thing,” Ishika Patel PHA President of DEI said.  “To live in a house with this many people, especially all girls.”

On a bright day down College Park Avenue, the laughter and shouts spewing off the Alpha Chi Omega balcony can be heard for blocks. Friends walking by receive a warm welcome as people venture through Old Town to their homes. 
</p>

<p>
But past the balcony of the Alpha Chi Omega house is where the memories began for many sorority members. Most women bunked up in triples and quads, are still actively learning the art of sharing 100% of your space and time. Although the friendships, theatric debrief sessions, and strong community are worth the decision to live Greek, according to members.  
</p>

<p>
Not many people can say they go home to over 30 roommates, but most members of Greek Life on the University of Maryland campus can. 16% of the Maryland undergraduate population belong to a Fraternity or Sorority. Over 40 Greek organizations occupy Fraternity Row and a ring of on-campus sorority houses called the “Graham Cracker.”
</p>

<p>
The Alpha Chi Omega house sticks out on the corner of College Avenue and Yale Avenue. The three-floor communal space houses up to 40 women with 18 bedrooms. Currently, all of the rooms are filled, but not up to full capacity with 35 living in. The majority of the women who currently live in the house are sophomores, although there are five juniors and one senior as well.

Senior Alexandra Terres has lived in the sorority house for three years now. She took on the role of Vice President of Facility Operations for three out of those five semesters on campus. She worked with the university and resident directors to keep the house running while managing the food, cleaning, and maintenance services. 
</p>

<p>
There is a two-semester requirement to live in the house for each member, according to the Alpha Chi Omega bylaws, but many willingly choose to because it is an easy option. The sorority house creates an off-campus experience but removes a lot of challenges of apartment living. A cleaning and food service is provided and the constant interaction reduces the stresses of finding a thriving social life. 
</p>

<div class="callout">
<p>
“A really fantastic community has come out of having this house. We have the privilege of being able to hold our chapter here, have chapter dinners here, have sisterhood events,” Terres said. “It's the common place for love, relationship growth, and friendship growth.” 
</p>
</div>


<p>
Terres, an engineering major, has faced a lot of judgment for living in a sorority house. Over the past three years, she learned how to combat the stigmas surrounding Greek Life and sorority living. Sorority girls are a common character and are usually portrayed as shallow and catty. People like to focus on the drama they believe to be happening, according to Terres. 
</p>

<div class= "callout">
<p>
“I think people like to focus on the negative of what could happen and not the immense joy that comes from living with your friends,” Terres said. “Great things that come out of it are like confidence, community, and true sisterhood in the way of like I will be there for you through whatever.”  
</p>
</div>

<p>
The confined living spaces do not come without its troubles. Some members find it difficult to not let their emotions or moods affect others, it can be hard to find alone time to recollect yourself. Out-of-state students especially struggle to find a space to have private conversations with their families, according to sophomore Lexi Bell. 
</p>

<p>
It can feel very exposing, living with so many people. While people sometimes feel like they can't hide, there is always someone around to see you and what you are going through according to Terres. 
</p>

<p>
Since 1948, the women of Alpha Chi Omega have called the house on College Avenue home. Today’s members continue to fill the rooms with laughter and fun, embracing this unique and memorable opportunity.
